## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to compile SAAS files
SAAS variables - makes it easy to maintain and update styles across a project
SAAS import - makes it possible to import modular pieces
SAAS mixins/includes - makes it easier and more efficient to write CSS by allowing you to nest your selectors inside one another
SAAS extend - when it is necessary for a class to have the styles of another class, along with its own specific styles
SAAS nesting - makes it easier and more efficient to write CSS by allowing you to nest your selectors inside one another
